#### Step 1

Open an FTP connection to the target Ewon device.

#### Step 2

Navigate to the /usr folder on the Ewon device's file system.

#### Step 3

Upload the downloaded connector files to the /usr folder.

- `flexy-canary-connector-A.B.C-full.jar` where A.B.C are the connector version numbers
- `jvmrun`
- `CanaryConnectorConfig.json`

##### Step 3a

If you have configured the connector to use a custom certificate, you will also need to upload the
certificate file (public key) to the /usr/connectorCertificates folder.

#### Step 4

Once the files have been uploaded, you may close the FTP connection and proceed to
the next section.
