## Version 1.0.2
### Features
- Added delay to allow sessions to expire after detecting data duplication on Canary
- Improved error logging for API responses to reduce log spam by counting identical error messages
  and logging them only once (with the count)
### Bug Fixes
- Resolved bug causing incorrect response statuses to be reported when multiple requests were made
  simultaneously
### Other
- Added issue templates for GitHub Issues creation
- Removed raw output logging of response bodies to eliminate duplicate messaging and redundant
  logging
- Removed a hardcoded API retry step which was redundant to the automatic retry mechanism and
  commonly resulted in the same error as the original request.
